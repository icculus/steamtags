# Steam Tags

I don't know if this still works, or if Steam's API has changed.

At one time, this let you point your public Steam profile at a
website that would let you tag games you own, and then use those
tags to categorize your library.

Since then, the Steam Client itself has added similar
functionality. This code is mostly here for historical purposes.
