# Steam Tags

This actually still works (January 2025), and you can try it at:

https://steamtags.icculus.org/

This lets you point your public Steam profile at a
website that would let you tag games you own, and then use those
tags to categorize your library.

Since then, the Steam Client itself has added similar
functionality. This code is mostly here for historical purposes.
